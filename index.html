    <!-- I only had two days to work on this project because of my grandpa's funeral and everything. 
    I wish I had time to put in more work but half of my time was spent trying to figure out how to 
    do the things I wanted and then scrapping them when I couldnt't figure it out. I'm taking 308 with 
    you next semester though so I'd really like to flex my creative muscles more then. Sorry again for 
    the barebones submission.-->
    <!-- Also i'm a little confused because on Canvas it says we can points deducted if we use a template but
    then directly below it has a template that we're supposed to start with. Am I going to get points deducted
    for this? I was working under the assumption this would be fine-->

                            out into the world. I have attended James Madison University in Virginia for four 
                            years now and using my knowledge to create.</p>
                        <p>I'm proficient in HTML and CSS. I'm also proficient in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrate,
                            and Indesign. I also use Clip Studio Paint and am able to use most Microsoft software.
                            I haven't had any real-world experience yet due to spending my summers making money
                            to pay off my college loans, but I'm hoping I can get some experience in the field soon.
